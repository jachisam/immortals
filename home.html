  <h3 style="text-align:center;">About the Film</h3>
  <center>
    <p><i>&#8220;When this world was still young, long before man or beast roamed these lands, there was a war in the heavens. Immortals, once thoughts incapable of death, discovered they had the power
       to kill one another. Lost in this war was a weapon of unimaginable power, the Epirus bow. The victors declared themselves Gods, while the vanquished were renamed Titans and forever imprisoned
       within the bowels of Mount Tartarus. Eons passed, mankind flourished and the great war receded from memory. But the evil that once was has reemerged.&#8221;</i></p>
    <p>Immortals weaves the story of one King Hyperion, whose apostasy has left him intoxicated with the power of war against humanity. Amassing a savage army of hoplites personally disfigured
       by the bloodthirsty king himself, Hyperion has scorched and plundered Greece in search of the legendary Epirus Bow, a weapon forged by Ares himself—a weapon so powerful, it has the power
       to unleash the Titans from the pits of Tartarus and annihilate the Olympians, who met his prayers with silence as Hyperion’s family fell sick and died. The Olympians are subject to ancient law,
       which forbids them from intervening in mortal affairs—until a peasant named Theseus is chosen by Zeus as the last hope for both the gods and for humanity. Along with his band of outsiders—including
       the oracular priestess Phaedra, and the Machiavellian slave Stavros—Theseus must defeat Hyperion and his forces, or watch his homeland fall to the Titans and his Gods vanish into legend.</p>

    <center>
      <b>Mononym, n. // A single name by which a person, thing, etc. is known</b>

<p>Tarsem is a director—a visionary, a philosopher, a storyteller. His directorial beginnings are rooted in music videos; in 1990 he directed En Vogue’s <i>&#8220;Hold On,&#8221;</i> in 1991 he directed R.E.M.’s smash hit <i>&#8220;Losing My Religion&#8221;</i> (which would win Best Video of the Year at the 1991 MTV Video Music Awards), in 1992 he directed Deep Forest’s <i>&#8220;Sweet Lullaby,&#8221;</i> and directed dozens of commercials for Nike, Coca-Cola, Levi’s, Guiness, Gatorade, Audi, Mercedes Benz, Toyota, Campari, Citroen, Volvo, Smirnoff, Verizon, Mountain Dew, MTV, Absolute Vodka, and the NFL throughout the 1990s and 2000s. Tarsem’s directorial debut was <i>&#8220;The Cell,&#8221;</i> a 2000 science fiction horror film starring Jennifer Lopez.</p>

<p>Tarsem’s <i>magnum opus</i>, however, was his 2003 Pepsi commercial, which starred Beyoncé, Britney Spears, and Pink as fierce gladiatrices who overtake a surly emperor (played by Enrique Iglesias) in his own coliseum—to the chants and hollers of Queen’s <i>&#8220;We Will Rock You.&#8221;</i> It is here that Tarsem discovered his love for the classics—and so <i>&#8220;Immortals&#8221;</i> was conceived</p>

<p>Tarsem’s sophomore film was <i>&#8220;The Fall,&#8221;</i> a 2006 adventure fantasy film starring Lee Pace and Justine Waddell. It wasn’t until 2011 that <i>&#8220;Immortals&#8221;</i> would make its way onto the silver screen—and once it did, Tarsem finally added &#8220;mythographer&#8221; to his résumé, too. </p>
