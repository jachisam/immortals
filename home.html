  <center>
    <p><i>&#8220;When this world was still young, long before man or beast roamed these lands, there was a war in the heavens. Immortals, once thoughts incapable of death, discovered they had the power
       to kill one another. Lost in this war was a weapon of unimaginable power, the Epirus bow. The victors declared themselves Gods, while the vanquished were renamed Titans and forever imprisoned
       within the bowels of Mount Tartarus. Eons passed, mankind flourished and the great war receded from memory. But the evil that once was has reemerged.&#8221;</i></p>
    <p>Immortals weaves the story of one King Hyperion, whose apostasy has left him intoxicated with the power of war against humanity. Amassing a savage army of hoplites personally disfigured
       by the bloodthirsty king himself, Hyperion has scorched and plundered Greece in search of the legendary Epirus Bow, a weapon forged by Ares himself—a weapon so powerful, it has the power
       to unleash the Titans from the pits of Tartarus and annihilate the Olympians, who met his prayers with silence as Hyperion’s family fell sick and died. The Olympians are subject to ancient law,
       which forbids them from intervening in mortal affairs—until a peasant named Theseus is chosen by Zeus as the last hope for both the gods and for humanity. Along with his band of outsiders—including
       the oracular priestess Phaedra, and the Machiavellian slave Stavros—Theseus must defeat Hyperion and his forces, or watch his homeland fall to the Titans and his Gods vanish into legend.</p>

    <h3 style="text-align:center; color:white;">About the Director</h3>
    <center>
      <p>Most, if not all, filmmakers are quick to label themselves as “artists,”
      but in Tarsem Singh’s case, it’s a legitimate branding. A graduate of
      Pasadena’s Art Center College of Design, the Indian visionary is quick
       to cite the painters’ influences in all of his movies, and the
       inspirations shows in bright, eye-stroking manners. For his debut,
       the phantasmagoric, Jennifer Lopez-starring thriller The Cell, Tarsem
       layered the flick with trippy imagery, namely the sight of a horse
       that gets split into pieces by falling glass; with his latest, and
       only third, feature, Immortals, he sent his mind back to the
       Renaissance, coloring the film to resemble the works of artist
       Michelangelo Caravaggio. Watching a Tarsem movie, particularly
       Immortals, is similar to visiting the Guggenheim and staring
       at the artwork while tripping on shrooms. And, yes, the experience
       is as fun as that sounds, even if the film itself isn’t an
       award-winner.</p>
