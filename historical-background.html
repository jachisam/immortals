  <h3 style="text-align:center;">Historical Context of the Film — The Era</h3>
  <center><p>The 13th century BC—an inflection point in history—during which we see a culture of destruction, unrest, and migration in the Near East and Mediterranean with the Late Bronze Age collapse and the earliest beginnings of the Iron Age. It is here that we place Immortals, in 1228 BC:  a time of turmoil, turbulence, and tension.</p>
<p>Although the Late Bronze Age collapse wouldn’t occur until circa 1200 and 1150 BC (the precise date is sometimes given as 1206 BC), this era still saw the disintegration of the palace economy system; the cultural collapse and political fragmentation of the Mycenaean kingdoms, the Hittite Empire and the New Kingdom of Egypt and the
   subsequent disruption of trade routes and in turn, literacy; and the destruction and abandonment of nearly every significant eastern Mediterranean city, such as Pylos, Thebes, and Mycenae. Nearly 90% of small sites in the Peloponnese were abandoned, indicating severe depopulation. These Dark Ages didn’t exclude Athens, who saw a
   reduction in power to the local level, limited trade, and an impoverished culture. By placing Theseus in this time, we effectively contribute to his depiction as a classic underdog: his is the story of a lowly, unsuspecting peasant—a non-citizen, mind you—living in the epicenter of Hyperion’s political and religious warzone, who is given
   the nearly insurmountable task of saving the Gods <i>and</i> the world at large.</p>

    <h3 style="text-align:center; color:white;">Historicity of Theseus — The Myth</h3>
    <center><p><p>The Greece we see in 1200s BC—A Greece of tension and turmoil—is not merely a perfect backdrop for the action of <i>Immortals</i>, or the embodiment of Hellenic strife that pervades both the film and history—it is also the period to which the legendary tales of Theseus are ascribed. Supplementing works such as Sophocles’
     <i>Oedipus at Colonus </i> and Euripides’ <i>The Suppliants</i> with archaeological findings of Mycenae and Troy, scholars such as Perry Westmoreland and Steven Diamant have estimated that had Theseus been a historical figure, he would have existed in the 13th century BC—or more accurately, the ancient Greeks <i>believed</i>
     Theseus had existed in the time we now know as the 13th century BC. In fact, these scholars have approximated Theseus to have slayed the Minotaur in 1263 BC (only 35 years prior to the time of <i>Immortals</i>) and his assassination at the hands of Lycomedes at around 1213 BC, making the events of <i>Immortals</i> a perfect fit for the mythological hero's timeline.</p> 
  <p>Just as the Greeks revised and reimagined their myths to reflect new ideas and cultural knowledge, we decided to keep with this tradition in creating <i>Immortals</i>.  Just as the film deviates from, say, Hesiod’s <i>Theogony</i> (in which the Titanomachy does not include mortals), or from traditional views on immortality (in the film, the Olympians are simply immortal,
     supernatural beings who declare themselves &ldquo;gods,&rdquo; and are able to kill one another), our depiction of Theseus diverges from the stories that precede it. In Book 8 of Ovid’s <i>Metamorphoses</i>, Theseus is an Athenian youth sent into King Minos’ labyrinth, and ultimately kills the Minotaur (with the help of Minos’ daughter, Ariadne, who he later abandons on the
     island of Naxos) and becomes a celebrated hero. In Euripides’ <i>The Suppliants</i>, Theseus is the powerful King of Athens who aids the Argive mothers in the return of their dead sons’ bodies by battling Creon’s forces. In Plutarch’s <i>Life of Theseus</i>, Theseus is a glorious king who has suppressed crime and brought Attica into the first democracy, but ends his days in
     disgrace after kidnapping the Queen of the Amazons, Antiope. But in <i>Immortals</i>, Theseus is an impoverished peasant who embarks on a perilous hero’s journey to save Olympus and the world—he is not a king, nor is he a renowned hero. Removing him from his traditionally noble and heroic backgrounds transforms him into a modern underdog: a lowly darkhorse who faces almost absolute
     death at the hands of a bloodthirsty tyrant and the most formidable beings in the Panhellenic tradition—the Titans.</p>

    <h3 style="text-align:center; color:white;">Directorial Choices</h3>
    <center><p>By situating <i>Immortals</i> in 1228 BC, we allowed the Theseus narrative to transcend from mere myth into history by simultaneously supplementing the myth with a historically accurate depiction of Greece during the 13th century BC, and by adding a fresh mythological interpretation to the historical &ldquo;timeline&rdquo; of Theseus.</p>

<p>As the directors, we brought the 13th century BC to life by transforming the film itself into an extended series of metaphors. More specifically, we envisioned the fall of the Olympian pantheon as a representation of the fall of the palace economy that had dominated the Mediterranean since the first half of the 2nd millennium BC—the gods here are the
   centralized power, the palace, and the mortals are the general population who rely substantially on the wealth and bounty of the “palace.” And so as the Olympians fall to Hyperion and the Titans, so does the traditional institution of the &ldquo;palace economy.&rdquo; Moreover, we represented the shift towards the Dark Ages of Ancient Greece through the
   dauntingly dark lighting that accompanies each shot of Hyperion—Hyperion here represents the new, coming age of darkness and turmoil that overtakes the old, fading age of lightness and prosperity of the Bronze Age (or, in this case, the Olympians). Furthermore, we depicted the weakened power of Athens through the depiction of Cassander (the King of the
  Hellenics) as a complacent and ineffectual leader with little military prowess.</p>
  
  <p>Ultimately, synergizing the mythology and historicity of the Theseus narrative wholly redefines Theseus as a modern underdog rather than the glorified founder-king of Athens by inundating the audience with illustrations of his humble origins and the grit and pain he endures
   when saving the world. In essence, just as Theseus is traditionally identified as the catalyst of cultural transition, he is here a classic underdog who saves the world from encroaching tyranny and champions a brighter, Olympian future.</p></center>
